/*! \file gmx_thread.h
 *
 *  @brief Platform-independent multithreading support.
 *
 *  This file provides an portable thread interface very similar to POSIX 
 *  threads, but the actual implementation is sometimes done with inline atomic
 *  operations in assembly for performance. 
 *
 *  In other words, while the naming conventions are very similar to 
 *  pthreads, you should NOT assume that a Gromacs thread type
 *  (thread,mutex,key, etc) is the same as the Pthreads equivalent,
 *  even on platforms where we are using pthreads. For instance, on 
 *  all platforms where it is possible we try to use lower-latency spinlocks
 *  instead of real posix style mutexes.
 *
 *  IMPORTANT:
 *  The Gromacs thread implementation is used to guarantee threadsafe 
 *  operation for the gmx_message.h functions, which in turn is used by
 *  the gmx_memory.h allocation stuff.
 *  This means we cannot use gmx_message() or gmx_new() memory calls 
 *  in the implementation.
 *
 *  Since this module is merely intended to be a transparent wrapper around
 *  a system-dependent thread implementation, we simply echo errors to stderr.
 *  The user should check the return codes\] and take appropriate action 
 *  when using these functions (fat chance, but errors are rare).
